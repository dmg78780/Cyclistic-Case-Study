Course: Google Business Intelligence https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence

# Background

In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic. Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in New York City, NY. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

# The Problem

Cyclistic's Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes: their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

# Project Goals:

- To understand how their customers are using their bikes
- Top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations
- Understand what customers want, what makes a successful product, how new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas.
- Understand how current line of bikes are used
- How can we apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth?
- How different users (subscribers and non-subscribers) use bikes.
